## Welcome to My Github Page

Don't have much to write on here yet but as my time in App Academy progresses I will add more things to keep this page current.

### Currently Going On

As of right now, I am a student at App Academy studying to become a full stack developer. If all goes well I will graduate on time, find a job quickly and pursue other dreams and aspirations that I have.
